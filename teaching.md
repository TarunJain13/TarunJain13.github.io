## <span style="color:#9b0f2f;">EdTech</span>

The education sector is being transformed by technology. Technology has allowed new pedagogical approaches, permitted greater personalization than ever before, and facilitated delivery at unprecedented scale. Yet open questions remain about EdTech—such as who EdTech should target, what should the right technologies be, what kinds of organization forms might be appropriate, and how to finance, regulate and staff the sector. This course discusses the state of the sunrise EdTech sector in India and globally, strategies to improve the quality and reach of the sector, and what kinds of entrepreneurial and research opportunities might exist for students.

Over 10 sessions, we gain a better factual understanding of how technology is used in the education sector. We examine players such as startups, schools, governments and tech developers, and their strengths and weaknesses. With this understanding, an important objective is to develop thoughtful business plans for entrepreneurs, and regulations to encourage positive development of the sector. 

The classroom pedagogy is a combination of case study discussion and lectures. This pedagogical style only works if students arrive prepared for each class – having read the material, with questions and ideas for discussion. Of course, we try to maximize using technology in delivering education in the course!

## <span style="color:#9b0f2f;">Indian Economy</span>

This is a 6 session introductory course on the vast Indian economy, covering topics that the instructor feels might be interesting to participants. We use a case-based methodology to discuss modern dilemmas that the economy faces, and debate approaches that an “economy manager” could take in improving equitable growth within the economy.
