        Peer influence and IT career choice

      The productivity of the Information Technology (IT) industry depends on the supply
      of high-quality human capital, especially managers who contribute to operational,
      finance, sales and marketing, and leadership roles. This study examines the influence
      of peers on the choice of management students to pursue careers in the IT industry.
      These choices may be informed and driven not only by own motivation and ability, but
      also by information gained through peers. Specifically, we analyze data on student
      networks at a leading business school in India, where students are exogenously
      assigned to peer groups, and link these to students’ choice of post-program careers
      in the IT industry. We find that being part of a group that includes peers who have
      worked in IT decreases the likelihood of receiving and accepting an offer in the IT
      industry. However, if a student has had no IT experience, having IT peers ameliorates
      this effect to a degree. We also find differential peer effects for male and female
      students. Our findings are consistent with IT peers providing more (discouraging)
      information on the IT industry to non-IT peers.
