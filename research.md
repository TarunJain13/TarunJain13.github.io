        Peer influence and IT career choice

      The productivity of the Information Technology (IT) industry depends on the supply
      of high-quality human capital, especially managers who contribute to operational,
      finance, sales and marketing, and leadership roles. This study examines the influence
      of peers on the choice of management students to pursue careers in the IT industry.
      These choices may be informed and driven not only by own motivation and ability, but
      also by information gained through peers. Specifically, we analyze data on student
      networks at a leading business school in India, where students are exogenously
      assigned to peer groups, and link these to students’ choice of post-program careers
      in the IT industry. We find that being part of a group that includes peers who have
      worked in IT decreases the likelihood of receiving and accepting an offer in the IT
      industry. However, if a student has had no IT experience, having IT peers ameliorates
      this effect to a degree. We also find differential peer effects for male and female
      students. Our findings are consistent with IT peers providing more (discouraging)
      information on the IT industry to non-IT peers.

        Lights out? COVID-19 containment policies and economic activity

      This paper estimates how strongly COVID-19 containment policies have impacted
      aggregate economic activity. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we
      analyze how containment zones of different severity across India affected
      district-level nighttime light intensity, as well as household income and
      consumption. From May to July 2020, nighttime light intensity was 9.1% lower in
      districts with the most severe restrictions compared with districts with the
      least severe restrictions, implying GDP losses of between 5.8% and 6.6%.
      Effects were largest during the graded lockdown in May and tapered thereafter.
      Stricter containment measures had larger impacts in districts with higher
      population density, older residents, and greater services employment.

        Reshaping adolescents' gender attitudes: Evidence from a school-based experiment in India

      This paper evaluates an intervention in India that engaged adolescent girls and boys in classroom discussions about gender equality for two years, aiming to reduce their support for societal norms that restrict women’s and girls’ opportunities. Using a randomized controlled trial, we find that the program made attitudes more supportive of gender equality by 0.18 standard deviations, or, equivalently, converted 16% of regressive attitudes. When we resurveyed study participants two years after the intervention had ended, the effects had persisted. The program also led to more gender-equal self-reported behavior, and we find weak evidence that it affected two revealed-preference measures.

        Women's labor force participation and household technology adoption

    <p style="margin:0; line-height:1.6;">
We examine how women's employment leads to household technology adoption in the context of mid-century United States. Using World War II factories and male casualty rates as an instrument for female labor demand, we find that the rise in women's labor force participation between 1940 and 1950 increased appliance ownership by 25 percent in the average county. This result holds in both panel and cross-sectional estimates, and for two different technologies. We find that increases in household income associated with women's employment is a salient channel and that the results are not driven by changes in the skill profile or employment outcomes of men, or migration patterns. Together, the evidence is consistent with a historiography that suggests that as women went to work, they adopted appliances with new purchasing and bargaining power.

    Science education and labor market outcomes in a developing economy

    <p style="margin:0; line-height:1.6;">
We examine the association between studying science in higher secondary school and labor market earnings in India. Studying science in high school is associated with 22% greater earnings than studying business or humanities. Earnings for science students are further enhanced with some fluency in English. Science education is also associated with more years of education, completing a professional degree, returns to entrepreneurship and working in public sector positions. Primary survey of high school students shows no discernible differences in behavioral characteristics of science students compared to others.</p>
