      <strong>IIM Ahmedabad Case</strong> <em>IIMA/RJMC0048</em>, with Ambrish Dongre.
    </p>

    <p style="margin:0; line-height:1.6;">
      The case summarises several EdTech implementations and the lessons learnt from their evaluation. It describes the challenges of traditional mode of teaching–learning when students in the same classroom have vastly differing learning levels of learning among students in a classroom. In such a situation, technology offers the promise of customising education at the individual level. The case discusses the implementation of personalised learning platforms such as I Can Learn in the United States, and Mindspark and ThinkZone in India for low-tech environments, as well as distribution of tablets to school students in Uttarakhand, India. Drawing on these implementations, the case further analyses how well the promise of EdTech holds today and what challenges remain for the sector.

        Fee Regulation in Private Schooling: The Case of Gujarat

    </h3>

      <strong>IIM Ahmedabad Case</strong> <em>IIMA/ECO366EX</em>, with Vertika Bansal, Shivam Kumar and Priyanka Sarda.
    </p>

    <p style="margin:0; line-height:1.6;">
The case analyses the impact of introducing fee caps on education services in the Indian state of Gujarat. Prior to 2017, tuition for private sector education in Gujarat was unregulated. The fee charged by these schools was contentious for two reasons – information asymmetry faced by parents and a huge year-on-year increase in the tuition fee. When parents opposed this, the Gujarat government introduced the Fee Regulation Act, 2017 (FRA) to regulate the fee charged by private schools by fixing an upper ceiling on the annual tuition fee at INR 15,000, INR 25,000, and INR 27,000 for the primary, secondary, and higher secondary classes, respectively. The case discusses the impact of this policy on several stakeholders – schools, teachers, parents and students.

India has the highest burden of soil-transmitted helminth infections globally, with 430 million children at risk of parasitic intestinal worms. This note analyses the impact of the Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP) in Kenya from 1998 to 2020. In the first follow-up, students were healthier and stayed in school longer. Twenty years later, participants who received the deworming treatment in the early years of PSDP experienced a substantial increase in adult consumption, hourly earnings and nonfarm employment. These significant adult outcomes make deworming an incredibly cost-effective solution for a pill costing about USD 0.45 per child per year. The COVID-19 pandemic confronts policymakers with a challenge: Since educational institutions are closed, how will the government deliver the deworming treatment?

Malaria is one of the most significant public health challenges facing India and other tropical countries. The technical note documents the effectiveness of policy responses to Malaria in India. It is valuable to understand how malaria eradication might help a generation of kids grow up without any serious threats to their long-term education, health and labour market outcomes. Large-scale disease eradication and development have a clear relationship. Thus, policymakers should consider these investments as critical components for improved health and economic growth. The note also highlights the evolving challenges around new malaria eradication programmes and strategies.

      <strong>Harvard Business Case</strong> <em>ISB096-PDF-ENG</em>, with Kalyani Chaudhuri.
    </p>

    <p style="margin:0; line-height:1.6;">
Every manager faces the problem of motivating employees to show up to work, focus on the assigned task, and work hard. In the absence of strong motivations to work or close monitoring by managers, employees tend to shirk, a phenomenon that economists call 'moral hazard'. In view of this problem, the worker's employment contract should be designed so that a part of the payoff (both monetary and non-monetary) is conditional on performance. In tasks where the manager can directly observe and monitor the worker's effort, designing such a conditional contract is easy. For example, a salesperson is offered a bonus directly depending upon the number of items he sells. However, when the effort is not so easily observable, overcoming potential moral hazard becomes harder. Using different policy experiments conducted with teachers in India, Kenya and United States, this case study explores how to motivate school teachers to turn up for class, teach well and put in maximum effort towards educating their students.</p>

Why is allocating courses to students in universities a challenging task? How difficult is it for institutions to strike a balance between the students' preferences over courses and what they can make available given the feasibility and other constraints? What are the plausible short-term and long-term effects of this demand-supply mismatch on students' university experiences and career aspirations? What are the relative pros and cons of allocation mechanisms such as course auctions, rank-order lists and random serial dictatorship used by academic administrators? Can universities design better systems that are simpler, fairer and cannot be gamed yet put students in courses they want? This case attempts to answer these questions by primarily examining the course allocation problem as a two-sided matching issue.

Does discrimination on the basis of gender, religion or ethnic origin exist in the job market? Why do employers use these factors in hiring decisions? Is discrimination equally prevalent in different sectors and in the presence of countervailing information? Are reasons for job market discrimination justified? What are possible strategies for combating job market discrimination? This case examines these questions in the context of hiring in the entry level white collar job market in an emerging economy.
